<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Kendrick Lamar To Pimp a Butterfly</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">For my final project I am performing a deep dive into the album To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar. I have split the project into INSERT NUMBER HERE sections to best be able to work through each part and obtain a complete understanding. This will help me analyze the album from different directions and hopefully come to a central conclusion after conducting research and organizing data. I think it is important for me to look around the edges of the album and consider more factors than simply what is being said. This is similar to what we have done in class to dive deeper into the data to understand who is saying this and why they are saying it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">Lyrics:<br>
I plan to analyze the lyrics of the album and look for trends and themes of black excellence and culture.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">I want to look at the themes of mental health awareness and being black in America as well.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Some songs that I will research in particular are “Mortal Man” and “Alright”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13">Contributors:<br>
For example, I will analyze the artists that are featured on the album, as well as those credited with helping the album</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">I will find trends or commonalities between these people</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">I will compare these people and some of their traits (years in the industry, race, following, how much music they output)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="20">Album Cover:<br>
The album cover of TPAB depicts a group of black men on the yard of the White House</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">Lamar has said that this is about taking a group of people to a place they have never been before<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="26">Reviews:<br>
Analyze album reviews and their themes/authors/background</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">This is another data point to see the public reaction to the album and whether there can be</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="31">Cultural Effects:<br>
“We hate po-po wanna kill us dead in the street for sure” this is one of Lamar’s most famous lines and has created discussion</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="34">Fox News reacted negatively to clips of Lamar singing this at the 2015 BET awards<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3_hi8eWdbY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3_hi8eWdbY</a></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">Lamar used the clip of them criticizing him in a future song, “BLOOD.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="39">Comparsions:<br>
I think it is important for me to compare these data and insight about TPAB to other works to see trends or differences</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">In a vacuum, what I find form TPAB may not be useful, but when juxtaposed with other works, more valuable knowledge can be gained</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">I will compare these aspects of the artists on this album to prior albums of Lamar’s, specifically “good kid, m.A.A.d city” and “Section.80”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">I may also be comparing it to &quot;If Youre Reading This Its Too Late” by Drake because it is an album from another black artist in the same genre in the same year</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="48">Methodology:<br>
I plan to collect data from the lyrics from Genius. Most of the other sections will require information either from Spotify or similar sites with information on the album. My plan to complete this research and assemble a conclusion will be to follow a structured approach. I will attempt to take on section at a time and aas I work through them, find connections to the other sections. My final goal is to prove TPAB’s impact and situate its place within the culture.</p>
